  <h1>Have you heard of the elusive pangolin?</h1>
    <p><a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pangolin>Pangolins</a> are a family of strange looking mammals, which by definition have hair and lactate.<br>
	Pangolins are covered with what appear to be scales, but they are actually made of keratin, the same<br>
	as human fingernails.  Their primary diet consists of ants and termites.<br><br>
	They are currently <strong>endangered</strong> due to poaching for traditional medicinal purposes.</p>
